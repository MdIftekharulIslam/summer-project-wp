Modern silviculture is based on simulating natural disturbance regimes on the one side and reducing their impact on the other side. Disturbances modify light regimes of forests along complex spatial patterns, and species participating in the ecosystem tend to have unique adaptations to the multitude of light conditions found in forests. We studied the height growth reaction of saplings from eight native North American tree species to different light availabilities in a Sierra Nevada mixed conifer forest. Large height growth differences occurred between species. Height growth increased for most species with increasing light availability. However, black oak but also incense cedar and tanoak reached an optimal value or saturation point of light availability at intermediate light levels, above which their growth stayed the same or slightly declined on average. A variety of stand conditions, representing the range from early to late successional stages, are beneficial to maintain tree species diversity across stands. Such a gradient of conditions can be achieved by diversifying silvicultural regimes and using regeneration approaches that mimic a range of disturbance intensities. The results add to knowledge on the species’ ecology by specifying their height growth in dependence of a quantified light environment. The quantification of the light environment can directly be linked to % canopy cover and a range of regeneration methods, respectively. With this, the results may help achieve a more precise and target-oriented management of Sierra Nevada mixed conifer forests.

Understanding climatic influences on annual basal area growth (ABAG) rates of individual trees is necessary to predict future stand dynamics. We fitted nonlinear ABAG models for shortleaf pine (<em>Pinus echinata</em>&nbsp;Mill.) with climate variables linearly added to the arguments of logistic and exponential multiplicative functions of climate variables as climate modifiers to incorporate 14 growing seasons and 30 month-specific climate variables including standardized precipitation index. Data were collected from permanently established plots in Arkansas and Oklahoma. Six re-measurement events collected between 1985 and 2014 provided five growth periods (GPs) and ABAG models were fitted using a mixed-effects approach. Model performance was evaluated using likelihood ratio tests and fit statistics. Climate variables from GPs expressed as deviations from long-term means that performed better than other candidate variables included (1) month-specific: June mean maximum air temperature (°C) (DTMAX6), and September precipitation (mm) (DPPT9); and (2) growing seasons: mean maximum air temperature (°C) (DGTMAX) and precipitation (mm) (DGPPT).

<p>Compared to&nbsp;<a href="https://theconversation.com/how-a-scientist-says-he-made-a-gene-edited-baby-and-what-health-worries-may-ensue-107764">gene-edited babies in China</a>&nbsp;and ambitious projects to rescue&nbsp;<a href="https://theconversation.com/mammoth-cloning-the-ethics-16183">woolly mammoths</a>&nbsp;from extinction, biotech trees might sound pretty tame.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But releasing genetically engineered trees into forests to counter threats to forest health represents a new frontier in biotechnology. Even as the techniques of molecular biology have advanced, humans have not yet released a genetically engineered plant that is intended to spread and persist in an unmanaged environment. Biotech trees – genetically engineered or gene-edited – offer just that possibility.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One thing is clear: The threats facing our forests are many, and the health of these ecosystems is getting worse. A 2012 assessment by the U.S. Forest Service estimated that nearly&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/foresthealth/technology/pdfs/2012_RiskMap_Exec_summary.pdf">7 percent of forests nationwide</a>&nbsp;are in danger of losing at least a quarter of their tree vegetation by 2027. This estimate may not sound too worrisome, but it is 40 percent higher than the previous estimate made just six years earlier.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In 2018, at the request of several U.S. federal agencies and the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.usendowment.org/">U.S. Endowment for Forestry and Communities</a>, the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nationalacademies.org/">National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine</a>&nbsp;formed a committee to “examine the potential use of&nbsp;<a href="http://nas-sites.org/dels/studies/forest-biotech/report-release/">biotechnology to mitigate threats to forest tree health</a>.” Experts, including me, a&nbsp;<a href="https://facultyclusters.ncsu.edu/people/jadelbor">social scientist focused on emerging biotechnologies</a>, were asked to “identify the ecological, ethical, and social implications of deploying biotechnology in forests, and develop a research agenda to address knowledge gaps.”</p>

Containment of transgenes inserted into genetically engineered forest trees will probably be necessary before most commercial uses are possible. This is a consequence of (1) high rates of gene dispersal by pollen and seed, (2) proximity of engineered trees in plantations to natural or feral stands of interfertile species, and (3) potentially undesirable ecological effects if certain transgenes become widely dispersed. In addition to gene containment, engineering of complete or male sterility may stimulate faster wood production, reduce production of allergenic pollen, and facilitate hybrid breeding. We review the regulatory and ecological rationale for engineering sterility, potentially useful floral genes, strategies for creating sterility-causing transgenes, and problems peculiar to engineering sterility in forest trees. Each of the two primary options — ablating floral tissues<em>via</em>&nbsp;floral promoter-cytotoxin fusions, and disrupting expression of essential floral genes by various methods of gene suppression — has advantages and disadvantages. Because promoters from structural and enzymatic floral-specific genes often work well in heterologous species, ablation methods based on these genes probably will not require cloning of homologs from angiosperm trees. Methods that inhibit gene expression will require cloning of tree genes and may be more prone to epigenetic variability, but should allow assay of transgene efficacy in seedlings. Practical constraints include the requirement for vegetative propagation if complete sterility is engineered and the need for highly stable forms of sterility in long-lived trees. The latter may require suppression of more than one floral gene or employment of more than one genetic mechanism for sterility.

Genetic engineering offers prospects of generating novel genotypes at an accelerated rate in the forest tree species. By employing&nbsp;<em>Agrobacterium</em>-mediated gene transfer system, a number of alien genes have been transferred to forest tree species (Fillatti et al. 1987; Klopfenstein et al. 1993; Nilsson et al. 1996; Tzfira et al. 1996; Fladung et al. 1997a; Holland et al. 1997). In addition, gene transfer has also been accomplished in the woody plants by biolistic DNA delivery system (Ellis et al. 1993; Charest et al. 1996; Walter et al. 1998a). Forest trees have long generation cycles with vegetative phases extending from one to several decades. Therefore, it is relevant to ask if the foreign genes would be stably integrated and expressed in the forest trees on a short-term as well as long-term basis (Ahuja, 1988a, 1988b; 1997). Genetic and phenotypic stability of transgenic trees is important for subsequent utility in the commercial forestry. In this direction, it would be desirable to isolate transgenic lines that are capable of moderate to high expression of the transgenes, and remain stable following vegetative and sexual reproduction. The transgenic plants must maintain a high degree of transgene expression during growth in the greenhouse, but most importantly under field conditions.

Edges are presumed to have deleterious consequences for the organisms that remain in forest fragments. However, there is substantial discrepancy among recent studies about the existence and intensity of edge effects. Most studies have focused on seeking simplistic and static patterns. Very few have tested mechanistic hypotheses or explored the factors that modulate edge effects. Consequently,studies are very site-specifci and their results cannot be generalized to produce a universal theory of edges. Although estimates of the intensity and impact of edge effects in fragmented forests are urgently required, little can be done to ameliorate edge effects unless their mechanics are better understood.

<p>At a research station in the Okanagan valley in British Columbia, a few kilometres outside the town of Vernon, orderly rows of trees run alongside the road. Many of the conifers stand tall and full, producing seeds destined for plantations around the province. But one dusty brown field is filled with lines of seedlings just ankle high. Greg O'Neill, 45, who planted the trees in April, walks among them with a slightly paternal air. They are part of a very slow experiment that will yield the first results that are useful to policy-makers just about in time for him to retire.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In a world in which many scientists fret about the toll that global warming is exacting on nature, O'Neill is actually doing something about it. A research scientist for the British Columbia Ministry of Forests, he is moving seedlings to areas that are outside their current comfort zone to test how they might handle the warmer conditions of the future. And he is behind a government push to move tree populations into new areas to prepare them for the warming climate.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Some hail the policy as pragmatic and forward-thinking, but others label it as dangerous and premature. Plants moved by humans may become invasive in their new haunts or just fail to thrive. Yet O'Neill thinks the potential gains in terms of timber production and forest health are worth the risk.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Canadian province is a pioneer in the field of adaptation, according to Gerald Rehfeldt, a retired United States Forest Service geneticist based in Moscow, Idaho, who has long championed moving trees. "British Columbia is ahead of everybody in the western hemisphere," he says.</p>

The nature of society's wood supply is changing. Traditionally, industrial wood has been harvested from natural forests created by nature. In the recent past, however, this situation has been changing. Planted forests have become common in some regions, e.g., much of Europe, over the past 200 years. Recently, since about 1960, intensively managed forest plantations have become increasingly common in a number of regions, including North America, Latin America, Oceania and parts of Asia. This paper explores some of the forces driving plantation forestry and some of the impacts. The experience of the U.S. is given as a type of "case study" of the types of changes that have occurred, and then a broader global discussion is undertaken. The effects of policy, technology and public attitudes on forestry are examined, both as they have influenced the past and as they are likely to impact forestry in the future.

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Forestry is a big industry in Finland and its seedling farms play a major role in keeping the sector alive because the small plants are the replacements for millions of trees felled every year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dagsmark is home to one of Finland's biggest tree seedling farms, Mellanå Plant.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The company's CEO,&nbsp;<strong>Rainer Bodman</strong>, explained that his facility has a capacity to produce some 20 million baby trees, providing about one-in-ten of the seedlings used to replenish Finland's industrial forests.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But the busy farm has had to deal with unusual turns in the weather, particularly this year's extremely dry summer.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"Our operations are very dependent on the weather and this year's extreme drought caused some difficulties in particular. We like sun and warm weather but planting of the seedlings were prematurely interrupted. Those were some of the plants that were left undelivered," Bodman said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"It was mostly land preparations that were cut short. If you don't get that work done by autumn, then it has to be done in the spring and early summer. If there's a forest fire warning issued, then of course land preps are called off. That's what happened this year - there wasn't enough prepared land to plant all the seedlings on," he explained.</p>

<p>The need to&nbsp;<a href="http://mifbi.org/">substitute renewable resources</a>&nbsp;for non-renewables is urgent because there is too much atmospheric carbon, other pollutants and related problems with many raw materials. Forests and wood products have a very important role to play.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Research and development of new uses for wood keeps going. Think about things such as car body parts,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.woodworkingnetwork.com/technology/wood-tires-could-hit-market-two-years">tires</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sustainablebrands.com/news_and_views/packaging/hannah_ritchie/carlsberg_working_develop_biodegradable_wood_fiber_bottle">water and pop bottles</a>, personal care products and&nbsp;<a href="ttps://www.theb1m.com/video/top-5-the-world-s-tallest-timber-buildings">high-rise buildings</a>. In fact, wood has&nbsp;<a href="https://www.woodworkingnetwork.com/technology/new-super-wood-10-times-stronger-could-replace-steel-says-scientists">replaced steel</a>&nbsp;for an increasing number of tall modern buildings, some as tall as nineteen stories.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Many new wood innovations may not be particularly flashy, but they make significant enhancements towards products and processes that reduce fossil fuel use, increase human safety, clean environments and lead to healthier communities and economies.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Wood has always been integral to human society and visions of a sustainable future will continue to include wood. However, there will be many ways to use wood that we currently just don’t see, and that’s pretty exciting.</p>

<p>Not everyone thinks of innovation when they think of Canada's forest products companies. But the federal government has fully recognized that the future of the forestry industry and its 230,000 workers depends on the success of its continuing commitment to innovation and sustainable development in every area of the forestry business.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The importance of this transformation was underscored by Natural Resources Minister Jim Carr in Ottawa's response to the new round of U.S. tariffs against Canadian softwood-lumber imports. Earlier this month, Mr. Carr announced the federal government would provide $867-million in funds to help the forestry industry in the wake of the unwarranted U.S. duties aimed at Canada.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In addition to critical support for forestry employees, the government earmarked a large portion of the new funding to support the sector's wide-ranging, transformative commitment to overhaul its operations for long-term, sustainable growth. While Mr. Carr's support package was primarily intended to assist softwood-lumber producers, funding for investments that will help all forestry products companies pursue modern, research-based operations and new markets will be available across the sector.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The importance of this support cannot be overstated. Canada is steward to 10 per cent of the world's forests, and by embracing strong environmental standards and committing to continuous improvement, Canada's forestry sector is recognized around the world as an environmental leader.</p>

Forest tree species are the most important component of the earth’s biomass and have important ecological and economical roles. In addition to those mechanisms, they are able to neutralize toxic substances, including CO<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;and other air pollutants, that pose a serious threat to human life and the ecosystem. They also have important role in environmental protection. The evolutionary survival of forest areas is an important aspect of environmental protection concerns. However, in near future, natural forest areas will in turn decline because the rapidly increasing global population will require more land devoted to agriculture to support the demand for increased food production. Moreover, forest areas for plantations will be limited to those highly unfavorable environments that pose various forms of stress, including drought, mineral deficiency, acidity, and increased air pollutants concentration on the trees. For the survival of forest trees, genotypes that have the ability to grow under unfavorable environments will be essential.

		<title>Economic Impacts on the Forest Sector of Increasing Forest Biodiversity Conservation in Finland</title>

<p>

In the next coming years, political decisions will be made upon future actions to safeguard
forest biodiversity in Southern Finland. We address the economic consequences on the Finnish
forest sector of conserving additional 0.5% to 5% of the old growth forest land in Southern
Finland. The impacts on supply, demand and prices of wood and forest industry production
are analysed employing a partial equilibrium model of the Finnish forest sector.
An increase in conservation raises wood prices and thus the production costs of the forest
industry. This makes sawnwood production fall, but does not affect paper and paperboard production. The forest owners’ aggregated wood sales income is unaffected or slightly increased,
because an increase in stumpage prices offsets the decrease in the harvests. If conservation
increases wood imports, negative effects on forest industry become smaller whereas aggregated
forest owners’ income may decline depending on the magnitude of import substitution.

Climate change affects the vulnerability and productivity of forestry and agricultural systems, predominantly by changes in precipitation and temperature patterns. Indirect impacts are altered risk of damage, for example, by longer periods of drought stress and other biotic and abiotic disturbances. While southern and eastern parts of the Baltic Sea basin are likely to experience a net impact of climate change that is negative for production, northern and western regions are likely to experience a general increase in production. As a result, land-use potentials will change and will foster adaptation and mitigation measures. In the northern region, forest management adaptation may lead to substantial yield increases, while in the south management, adaptation may be required to counter deteriorating conditions. Comparable conclusions can be drawn for agricultural management: if adaptation potentials are fully exploited, substantial yield increases can be expected for certain crop species. In the southern areas and for certain species, deteriorating conditions and possibly increasing climatic variability are projected. Both climate change impacts and human responses will affect socio‐economic conditions in the Baltic Sea basin.

<p>Forests are one of the most mismanaged resources in many countries. This is partly because forests are seriously undervalued and many of their environmental benefits are not captured by market values. Uncoordinated policies (for example agriculture, energy, mining and transportation policies) also affect forest cover. And poor governance has fueled corruption, rent-seeking and illegal activities.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At the same time, forests have a critical role to play in green growth. Forests can help meet the growing demands for food, fiber, biofuel, shelter, and other bio-products as the world population increases to 9 billion people by 2050. Because forest resources are solar-powered,renewable, and store carbon as they grow, they also have the potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate climate change by taking the place of nonrenewable materials andsubstituting for fossil fuels. The forest sector is also an important source of both formal and informal jobs, particularly in remote areas where there are few economic alternatives.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The World Bank and the Program on Forests, housed at the Bank, help governments steer economic policy in a “forest-friendly” way. Improving the governance of the forest sector so that it is more transparent and accountable is also a priority. Because private sector investment in the forest sector in developing countries is seven times greater than the total official development assistance (about $US1.5 billion) for the forest sector, it is essential to engage the private sector – including small and medium forest enterprises – to achieve inclusive green growth.</p>

		<title>Economic Development and Forest Cover: Evidence from Satellite Data</title>

<p>

Ongoing deforestation is a pressing, global environmental issue with direct impacts on climate change, carbon emissions, and biodiversity. There is an intuitive link between economic development and overexploitation of natural resources including forests, but this relationship has proven difficult to establish empirically due to both inadequate data and convoluting geo-climactic factors. In this analysis, we use satellite data on forest cover along national borders in order to study the determinants of deforestation differences across countries. Controlling for trans-border geo-climactic differences, we find that income per capita is the most robust determinant of differences in cross-border forest cover. We show that the marginal effect of per capita income growth on forest cover is strongest at the earliest stages of economic development, and weakens in more advanced economies, presenting some of the strongest evidence to date for the existence of at least half of an environmental Kuznets curve for deforestation.
